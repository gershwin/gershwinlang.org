## Example Code ##

Currently the best code examples are the demos available under the [Gershwin Github organization](https://github.com/gershwin), specifically:

 * [Presentation Builder](https://github.com/gershwin/demo.prez)
 * [Gershwin System Shell](https://github.com/gershwin/demo.shell)

As always, don't forget to peruse the [tests for the language itself](https://github.com/gershwin/gershwin/blob/master/test/gershwin/test_gershwin/core.gwn).
